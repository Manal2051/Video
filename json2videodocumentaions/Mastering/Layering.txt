Layering#
Layering elements in a scene or movie#
In JSON2Video, the order of elements within the elements array of a scene or movie dictates their layering. Elements listed later in the array are rendered on top of those listed earlier. This behavior mirrors the stacking context in HTML and CSS.

Elements array order#
The elements array order is the primary method for controlling layering. Elements listed later in the array are rendered on top of those listed earlier.

Key Points:

The first element in the array is the bottom-most layer.
Each subsequent element is placed above the previous one.
The last element in the array is the top-most layer and will obscure any overlapping elements beneath it.
Example

Consider the following JSON snippet:

{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "duration": 10,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "image",
          "src": "background.jpg",
          "x": 0,
          "y": 0,
          "width": 1920,
          "height": 1080
        },
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Hello World"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Copy
In this example, the image specified by background.jpg will be the background layer. The text "Hello World" will be rendered on top of the image.

Overlapping Elements:

If elements have overlapping coordinate spaces, the element with the higher stacking order will visually cover the element(s) below it.

Controlling Layering with z-index#
While the order in the elements array is the primary method for controlling layering, you can use the z-index property for more explicit control. The z-index property allows you to define the stacking order within a range of -99 to 99. Elements with higher z-index values are rendered on top of elements with lower values.

Example:

{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "duration": 10,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Hello World",
          "z-index": 1
        },
        {
          "type": "image",
          "src": "background.jpg",
          "z-index": -1
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Copy
In this example, the text continues to be rendered on top of the image, even though it's listed earlier in the elements array because the z-index of the text is set to 1 and the z-index of the image is set to -1.

Transparent scenes with video backgrounds#
By default, the elements in the Movie elements array are layered over the scenes. This is helpful for adding a logo, a watermark, or any other element on top of all scenes.

But what if you want the scenes to have a transparent background and show a video background?

You can achieve this by setting the background-color property of the scene objects to transparent and adding a video element to the elements array with a z-index lower than 0. Scenes always have a z-index of 0, so the video will be rendered behind the scenes.

Example

{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "comment": "Scene 1",
      "background-color": "transparent",
      "duration": 5,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "This is scene 1"
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      "comment": "Scene 2",
      "background-color": "transparent",
      "duration": 5,
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "This is scene 2"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "elements": [
    {
      "type": "video",
      "src": "https://cdn.json2video.com/assets/videos/beach-04.mp4",
      "z-index": -1
    }
  ]
}
Copy
In this example, the scenes have a transparent background and the video is shown through the transparent background of the scenes. The video is set to have a z-index of -1, which means it will be rendered behind the scenes.
