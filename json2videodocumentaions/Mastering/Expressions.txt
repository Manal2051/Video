Expressions#
Expressions allow you to perform calculations and conditional logic directly within your JSON2Video templates. They are enclosed in double curly braces {{ and }} and evaluated during the video rendering process, enabling dynamic customization of your videos.

Syntax#
Expressions must be enclosed in double curly braces: {{ expression }}.

Use Cases#
Expressions can be used in various places within a movie template to dynamically set values, including:

Element durations
Text content
Conditional rendering of elements or scenes
CSS properties within components
Supported Operators and Functions#
JSON2Video supports the following operators and functions within expressions:

Arithmetic Operators: + (addition), - (subtraction), * (multiplication), / (division)
Comparison Operators: == (equal to), != (not equal to), > (greater than), < (less than), >= (greater than or equal to), <= (less than or equal to)
Logical Operators: and (logical AND), or (logical OR)
Ternary Operator: condition ? value_if_true : value_if_false
Math Functions: min(a, b) (returns the minimum of a and b), max(a, b) (returns the maximum of a and b)
Examples#
Here are some practical examples of how to use expressions:

Dynamic Element Duration#
{
  "variables": {
    "base_duration": 5
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "Dynamic Duration",
          "duration": "{{ base_duration + 2 }}" // Duration will be 7 seconds
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Copy
In this example, the duration of the text element is dynamically calculated by adding 2 seconds to the value of the base_duration variable.

Conditional Text Content#
{
  "variables": {
    "show_alternate_text": true,
    "primary_text": "Hello",
    "secondary_text": "Goodbye"
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "text",
          "text": "{{ show_alternate_text ? secondary_text : primary_text }}"
          //If show_alternate_text is true, the text will be "Goodbye". Otherwise, it will be "Hello".
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Copy
This example uses the ternary operator to dynamically set the text content based on the boolean value of the show_alternate_text variable.

Setting a Component's width#
{
  "comment": "Variables example",
  "resolution": "full-hd",
  "variables": {
      "base_width": 100,
      "scaling_factor": 0.5
  },
  "scenes": [
    {
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "component",
          "component": "basic/000",
          "width": "{{ base_width * scaling_factor }}"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
Copy
In this example, the width of the component is dynamically calculated by multiplying the value of the base_width variable by the value of the scaling_factor variable.
