Getting your API key#
To use the JSON2Video API, you'll need an API key. This key is used to authenticate your requests and authorize access to the API.

There are two types of API keys:

Primary API key: This key is automatically generated when you sign up for a JSON2Video account. It has full administrative access to your account, allowing you to perform all available operations.
Secondary API keys: These keys can be created from the API Keys page in the dashboard (available for paid plans only). They offer more granular control over permissions.
Creating Secondary API Keys#
Paid plan users can create secondary API keys with different permission roles:

Render: Allows the API key to be used for creating videos using the /movies endpoint.
Editor: Includes Render permissions and also grants the ability to create and edit templates.
Manager: Encompasses Editor permissions and further allows the creation and modification of connections.
Security Recommendations#
Your API key is sensitive information and should be treated with care. Follow these recommendations to ensure the security of your account:

Keep your API key secret: Never share your API key with anyone.
Don't share your API key: Avoid storing your API key in public repositories or other insecure locations.
Regenerate your API key if it's compromised: If you suspect that your API key has been compromised, immediately regenerate it from the dashboard. This will invalidate the old key and prevent unauthorized access.
API keys should not be used in client-side code: Exposing your API key in client-side code (e.g., JavaScript in a web browser) makes it vulnerable to unauthorized use. Always perform API calls from a secure server-side environment.
