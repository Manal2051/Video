Example using the ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 model:

ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 model is a faster way to generate voiceovers that also supports a wide range of voices and languages. The credit consumption is the same of the ElevenLabs model. To generate a voiceover using Flash v2.5, use elevenlabs-flash-v2-5 as the value for the property model:

{
  "scenes": [
    {
      "elements": [
        {
          "type": "voice",
          "model": "elevenlabs-flash-v2-5",
          "voice": "Adam",
          "text": "Hello, I am an ElevenLabs Flash v2.5 generated voiceover."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
